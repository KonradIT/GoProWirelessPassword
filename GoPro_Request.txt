This is feedback regarding the security around GoPro's WiFi password on late GoPro models, including Hero5, Hero6, Fusion and Hero 2018.

1) The password can be accessed by anyone, all it takes is to swipe down on the camera menu, tap connect then tap "name & password". 
2) There is no indication of wifi being active other than a small symbol at the top left of the screen, no blue LEDs unlike Hero 3, Hero 4.
3) Passwords can changed without any verification, in the connect menu the attacker would tap RESET connections to get a new auto-generated password
4) Password can be gathered remotely as well:
    - When pairing with the mobile device, an attacker would connect to the GoPro via bluetooth and get the password.
    - Really important: GoPro's auto-generated pseudorandom passwords are easily cracked, the layout is [word] + [4 numbers]. A dictionary of most common words is freely available online, it does not take long to crack such password.

Here are some security recommendations:

- The RESET password option should require a GoPro App connection, so only the original owner can change the password. This might be a disadvantage for second-hand GoPro owners, who might want to change the password, the fix would be to connect the camera to a computer and change the password.
- Don't show the password on the camera itself, or at least require a 4 digit pin code.
- Allow for users to change their passwords to something stronger and memorable.
- Don't transmit the password over Bluetooth.
